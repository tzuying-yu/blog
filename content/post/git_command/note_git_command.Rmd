# You only need to know these basic Git commands to push the local project to Github!

### Preamble
This is a note that I wrote back when I tried to push my blogdown project in Rstudio to Github. I didn't have any experience in writing Git commands then. Therefore, this note is more for beginners who might feel stuck while first pushing local repository to github's remote repository.

### Workflow 
In this setting, I wished to push my blogdown project.So first of all, I will need to create a project with blogdown.[^1]\
Go to `File > New Project > New Directory > Website` using blogdown, then click create.\
\*Note: In this step, you have to choose a Hugo theme. According to author of the blogdown, it is always the best to start with the default theme. Once you are familiar with the Hugo you can play with different theme.\

Then, go to the Terminal at the bottom of the interface. And follow the below steps.\

#### Step 1: Checking the directory.
* Checking the directory you are working with is the preliminary step, it decides the files you are able to push to Github.
* Example: I want to push the whole <font color="blue">blog_website</font> directory. The first line showing in the terminal should look like,\
`Nicoles-MacBook-Air:<font color="blue">blog_website</font> nicoleyu$`
If not, command the following line,\
`cd <your own working directory>`\
\
\* Notes: `cd` means "change directory" in terminal command.

#### Step 2:  Initializing a new repository.
* Code:`git init` 
* This is a one-time command during the initial setup. You only need to do this once for each new repository. It creates a new ".git" subdirectory in your current working directory you set in the first place. [^2]

#### Step 3: Set up remote connection with other repositories.
* Code: `git remote add <local repository's name> <github project's URL>`
* This is also an one-time command,and it creates a new connection with the remote repository. After setting up the connection, youâ€™ll be able to call <local repository's name> as a convenient shortcut for <github project's URL> in other Git commands.[^3]
\*Notes: In most case, we use `origin` as the name for the first connection but you can always set it with your preferred name. 
  
#### Step 4: Add the files you want to push to the github.
* Code: `git add .`
* This save the current version of all qualified files, which have never been pushed or have been changed in your working directory, to the staging area.[^4] The staging area is like a rough draft space where stores files you want to push in your next commit. 

#### Step 5: Commit to the changes you made in the last step.
* Code: `git commit -m <"message you want to made for this command">
* This command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.And also you can add messages to your current change.[^4] 
\*Notes: The option `-m` means "message".

#### Step 6: Finally, push the changes to the Githhub.
* Code: `git push <remote repository's name> <branch>`
* This command pushes the local branch to the Github's remote repository.    
\*Notes: You can find the branch in the current_working_directory/.git/ > config file. \
\
Now you can check the pull request on your Github.And you're done!

### Code summary:
```{}
# Summary of the workflow:
cd <working directory>
git init
git remote add <local repo name> <github project url>
git add .
git commit -m <messages>
git push <local repo name> <branch>

#Some useful checking tool
## Listing the files in the terminal 
ls 
## Showing the state of the working directory and the staging area
git status

```
  
  
[TODO]
- how to undo each step
- working directory -> commit  -> local repo (master) -> central repo (main)
